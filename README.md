Arduino
=======
Just a few projects I've been working on from the Arduino kit.  Great introduction to the open source electronics platform: http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoStarterKit   

We're using Arduinos on a separate project (see SolarSunflower) which is part of 'Code For Philly' and make use of a few extra shields/components: WiFi, Data Logging to SD and Real Time Clock.
